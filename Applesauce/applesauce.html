      She's pretty <strong>fun</strong>, I guess, but also sometimes <em>annoying</em>. Sometimes I am afraid that we are starving her, because she continually wants more food, the little fatty.

    <h2>Why she's fun</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>She's hairy</li>
      <li>She likes to talk a lot</li>
      <li>She's an automatic alarm clock.</li>
