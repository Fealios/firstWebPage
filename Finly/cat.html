    <h1>Finly is crazy</h1>
    <p>Finly is an extremely noisy cat, who will stand inside of the shower and scream at you, I'm assuming out of fear for you of the water. It's probably the most annoying part of her personality, but it's also always hilarious.</p>

    <h2>Things Finly likes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not being pet but asking for pets</li>
      <li>Crying</li>
      <li>Her shoe string</li>
    </ul>
